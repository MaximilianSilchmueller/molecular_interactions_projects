"""
Description: This program creates an application that stores molecular structures in a specified format and generates a CSV file to compare interaction sites (contact residues) of amino acid side chains between a molecule and a target protein. The molecule is considered as chain A and the target molecule as chain B. The interaction and folding configuration is handled by AlphaFold (AI tool). The input is PDB files generated by AlphaFold. The output is a list of amino acid side chains potentially contacting (within 5 Å) an amino acid of the other chain and a summary of which molecule has the most contact residues. The end goal is to estimate which molecule interacts well with the target protein. The final objective is to have a working environment with an executable that automatically extracts the necessary images from the online database and the code for PyMOL, creating a CSV file indicating the number of contact residues for each molecule.

Workflow:
1. Install Python, PyMOL, and the free version of PyMOL.
2. Create a script that automatically downloads the required PDB files from the online database into your folder.
3. Develop a PyMOL script that evaluates the contact residues within 5 Å, lists them, and outputs the number of contact residues for each molecule.
